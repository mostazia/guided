  description: `Want to have a productive study session but don't know where to start? Or, do you just need an on-the-go resource for a quick cram? (We've all been there) Whatever your study situation may look like, this One Pager will get the job done. This download summarizes the entirety of the eigth AP Biology unit, Ecology, in ONE page, front and back. It is based on College Board's very own Course and Exam Description to ensure that it provides a complete summary. Additionally, the One Pager organizes and compartmentalizes its content by CED topic, so if you find anything confusing, you can easily find more information. Packed with illustrations, diagrams, real-world examples, and vocabulary, this tool will not display the covered content, but explain it; it's clear, concise, compact, and comprehensive. Whether you just need to review environmental responses, energy flow, ecosystems, adaptation, the population ecology equations, community ecology, or biodiversity, this resource covers it! <br/> <br/> I hand designed and created these One Pagers when I was an AP Biology student. And, they played a huge role in helping me earn a 5 on my AP exam. Their impact was so significant that I refused to throw them out once I graduated. Now, I have digitalized and updated them, so that students can download, print, and incorporate them into their own academic journeys. I had a blast creating these, and I'm so proud of the final product. Oh, and did I mention they are COMPLETELY FREE. Don't think twice and let these One Pagers organize your study sessions and improve your grade!`,
