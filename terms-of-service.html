          'as available' for your use, without any representation, warranties or
          conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including all

          including, without limitation lost profits, lost revenue, lost
          savings, loss of data, replacement costs, or any similar damages,
          whether based in contract, tort (including negligence), strict

          or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of
          the service or any content (or product) posted, transmitted, or
          otherwise made available via the service, even if advised of their
